### About ISMIR 2022

The annual conference of the International Society for Music Information Retrieval
(ISMIR) will be held in Bengaluru, India from December 4-8, 2022. ISMIR represents the
largest body of scholars, researchers and practitioners in the field of music information
retrieval (MIR), an interdisciplinary research area concerned with processing, analysing,
organising and accessing music information. The scope of ISMIR extends across the
fields of computer science, musicology, cognitive science, library & information science
and electrical engineering. With its strong research and application leanings, the ISMIR
conference has traditionally been supported by prominent names in the music industry
across the world.

### Sponsorship Opportunities

ISMIR 2022 will be organized in a hybrid mode where we expect around 150 participants
attending physically and over 800 participants virtually from around the world.
ISMIR 2022 offers sponsorship opportunities for the main conference event in Platinum,
Gold, Silver tiers, and as a Supporter. Taking this opportunity to become a valued sponsor
of the conference provides you a platform to:
- Showcase your organization’s latest research and products to an International
community of MIR researchers and practitioners
- Recruit top technical talent
- Follow state of the art in music information research and technologies

In addition to the main conference sponsorship, you may support Women in Music
Information Retrieval (WiMIR) and Diversity & Inclusion initiatives that are an integral part
of ISMIR 2022. The benefits for conference sponsorship and WiMIR sponsorship are
