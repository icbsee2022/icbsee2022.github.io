<h3 id="about-ismir-2022">About ISMIR 2022</h3>

<p>The annual conference of the International Society for Music Information Retrieval
(ISMIR) will be held in Bengaluru, India from December 4-8, 2022. ISMIR represents the
largest body of scholars, researchers and practitioners in the field of music information
retrieval (MIR), an interdisciplinary research area concerned with processing, analysing,
organising and accessing music information. The scope of ISMIR extends across the
fields of computer science, musicology, cognitive science, library &amp; information science
and electrical engineering. With its strong research and application leanings, the ISMIR
conference has traditionally been supported by prominent names in the music industry
across the world.</p>

<h3 id="sponsorship-opportunities">Sponsorship Opportunities</h3>

<p>ISMIR 2022 will be organized in a hybrid mode where we expect around 150 participants
attending physically and over 800 participants virtually from around the world.
